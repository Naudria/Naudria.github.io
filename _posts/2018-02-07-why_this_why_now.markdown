I've been asked that question a lot lately, when I tell people I've enrolled in a software development course. Some of the questions I've gotten are:

"I thought you were an artist? Where did this desire to become a coder come from?"
*Answer: It's always interested me. I was just too intimidated by numbers to try for the longest time.*

"You're looking to change careers at 39?"
*Answer: Yep. You got a problem with that?*

"How are you going to fit this into your already-busy schedule?"
*Answer: Where there's a will, there's a way.*

In case you hadn't guessed, I am 39 (40 in April, God help me), and a working mom. I work as a graphic designer for a small magazine publisher. I have a law degree, but discovered very quickly that I had zero interest in pursuing a legal career. Rather, I've always been drawn to technology and design. I love when things look good and work well. I found that I loved tinkering with websites, figuring out how to make them pretty, but also run smoothly. When my employer suddenly announced that I was the company's "Web Master," I panicked. I was hardly a "master" of anything, let alone the Web. But, I was definitely *driven* to master it. And really, isn't that the most important trait to succeed?

Other factors pushed me to commit: I want to command a higher salary, I want to flexibility of working remotely, I want to be a woman who has succeeded in tech. (The last one may seem superficial, but there you have it.)

So here I am, slogging through Ruby. My artist's brain sometimes struggles to understand why something works the way it does. I'm trying to learn how to learn, and it's hard.

But strangely enough, I'm loving it.
